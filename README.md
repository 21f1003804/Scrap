# webHub Event Listings Scraper

A high-performance, asynchronous Python scraper for educational purposes that demonstrates web scraping techniques using modern async/await patterns.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This project is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

- 🎓 **Academic Use Only**: This scraper is designed for learning web scraping concepts, async programming, and data analysis
- 🚫 **No Commercial Use**: Commercial use of this scraper is strictly prohibited
- 📚 **Educational Intent**: Use this code to understand scraping techniques, not for business purposes
- ⚖️ **Respect Terms of Service**: Always respect website terms of service and robots.txt
- 🤝 **Ethical Scraping**: Use responsibly with appropriate delays and rate limiting

## 🚀 Features

- **High-Performance Async**: Uses `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for concurrent requests
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays and retry mechanisms
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handles timeouts, rate limits, and server errors
- **CSV Export**: Automatically saves data to CSV with timestamps
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during scraping
- **Optimized Performance**: Optional `uvloop` support for maximum speed

## 📋 Requirements

```bash
pip install aiohttp asyncio beautifulsoup4 uvloop


🛠️ Installation
Clone this repository:
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webhub-scraper-educational
cd webhub-scraper-educational
Install dependencies:
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the scraper:
Copy
python scrape_event_listings.py
📊 What It Does
Fetches Event Data: Scrapes event listing information from webHub
Async Processing: Uses concurrent requests for fast data collection
Data Extraction: Extracts key fields like:
Ticket prices and sections
Seat information
Availability
Deal scores and ratings
CSV Export: Saves data to timestamped CSV files
Statistics: Shows price ranges and summary stats
🔧 Configuration
Modify these parameters in the script:

Copy
# Adjust concurrency (be respectful!)
scraper = FastwebHubScraper(
    max_workers=20,      # Concurrent requests
    max_connections=60   # Connection pool size
)
📁 Output
The scraper generates CSV files with format:

Copy
webhub_[event_name]_[timestamp].csv
Contains columns:

id, section, row, seat
availableTickets, rawPrice, priceUSD
ticketClass, dealScore, starRating
And more...
🎯 Example Usage
Copy
# Change the URL to your target event
base_url = "https://www.webhub.com/your-event-url/"

scraper = FastwebHubScraper(max_workers=10)
listings = await scraper.scrape_all_pages_fast(base_url)
scraper.save_to_csv(listings, "my_event")
📈 Performance
Speed: ~50-100 listings/second (depending on network)
Efficiency: Batched async requests with connection pooling
Memory: Optimized for large datasets
